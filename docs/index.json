Creating an empty mod visualization in Spotfire Open an analysis in Spotfire and then go to Tools \u0026gt; Create visualization mod. This will create an empty mod with a link to the example projects and a button to open the mod developer settings.\nContinue by downloading the mod examples zip archive. The archive is available on the empty page or from the mod developer settings menu.\n2. Pick a mod example The mod-examples.zip files contains a set of examples using the mod API in various ways. They can be used as a starting point when developing a new mod. Examples in the javascript-examples folder are written in JavaScript and the examples in the typescript-examples folder are written in TypeScript. The TypeScript examples include build tools to generate minified JavaScript.\nExtract the zip archive and open one of the example projects, e.g \u0026ldquo;javascript-examples/mod-example\u0026rdquo; in VS Code.\n3. Start local development server Start the mod example by starting the build task in VS Code. This will install necessary development dependencies and start a local web server (the task is defined in the vscode settings folder). The task should launch a url in your browser to the mod manifest.\n\n4. Connect development server to Spotfire mod visualization Switch over to Spotfire and open the mod developer settings. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Use development server\u0026rdquo;, make sure that the displayed url matches the url opened in your browser, and thereafter click on the \u0026ldquo;Connect\u0026rdquo; button. This will make Spotfire navigate to your local server and serve files from your src folder.\n\nIf a visualization appears, it means that Spotfire has successfully connected to the development server. Now switch over to VS Code to start editing the mod implementation.\nThe src folder includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that together form the mod implementation. It also contains a manifest.json file that contains metadata about the mod. If any .html/css/js file in the src folder is changed while the development server is running, the mod will be reloaded in Spotfire.\nAs an example, open the main.css file and try to change the background property of body. As soon as the css file is saved, the change will appear in Spotfire.\n","excerpt":"1.

Development can be done against the Windows client or the Web client.\nPrerequisites While a mod does not strictly depend on any external tools to work, there are a few tools that are highly recommended to make the development workflow smooth. It is highly recommended to use Visual Studio Code when developing a mod. The mod example include predefined settings for VS Code that enable a default build task, intellisense in the mod manifest and intellisense in the JavaScript code.\n To enable live updates when developing a mod, a set of tools based on Node.js are needed. The mod example specifies a set of development dependencies in its package.json file. These are installed when executing npm install in the same directory as the package.json file. The install script is also executed as part of the default build task in VS Code.\n ","excerpt":"Developing a mod To develop and test a mod you need a running instance of Spotfire.
