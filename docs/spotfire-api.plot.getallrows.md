## Plot.getAllRows() method

Gets all rows from the data view as one asynchronous operation. The getAllRows function has a built in cache and can be called multiple times with the same dataView and it will return the same list of rows.

\*\*NOTE\*\*: This is a helper method for dataView.getIterator(), if you plan to handle many rows it is advised to use the iterator API instead. If you want to transform each row as it's retrieved, use getIterator() instead.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getAllRows(dataView: DataView): Promise<DataViewRow[]>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  dataView | <code>DataView</code> | Data view to get rows from. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<DataViewRow[]>`
