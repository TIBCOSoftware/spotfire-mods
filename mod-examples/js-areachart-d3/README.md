# Area Chart 
This is a complex mod example demonstrating an area chart rendered with `d3` and bundled with `Webpack`.


## How to get started
- execute `npm install`. This will install necessary tools.
- execute `npm start`. This will bundle the JavaScript and place it in the `dist` folder. This task is a watcher that will continue running until it is stopped.
- execute `npm run server` in a separate terminal. This will start a development server.
- Start editing, e.g `src/index.js`
